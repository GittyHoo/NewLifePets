# NewLifePets
Welcome to my code! In this read.me I'll help you get through the (many) steps you need to take to download and install this feature.

# The feature
The feature in short: the feature I built is a swiping feature (think tinder) where people can search for potential new pets from shelters all around. With this feature you can swipe the pets you'd like to match with! 

# How do I download and install this feature?
Before you can do anything, you first need to download and install a few different applications/software. 

I used: Npm, nodemon, express and mongodb to built and support the swiping feature. See the following links how to download and install these applications.

Npm:        https://www.npmjs.com/
Nodemon:    https://nodemon.io/
Express:    https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html
MongoDB:    https://www.mongodb.com/

# Which html, css and javascript documents do I need to work with?
Of course, when you download and install my feature, you'll get a lot of different documents with it. The most important documents(for changing things) are: views > home.handlebars (this document is used to change the html of the webpage), static > css > style.css (this document is used to change the style of the webpage) and js > script.js(this document is to change the javascript of the webpage) Of course there are many other documents inside of this folder, like the: connect.js(for the database:mongoDB), index.js(for the handlebars, routes, etc) and much more.
